I develop computational approaches for designing and controlling systems of mobile robotic agents.
I am targeting applications in entomology, forestry, ecology, 
micro-robotics for health and microbiology. These settings are challenging for traditional 
approaches to control and planning for mobile robots, due to unpredictable environmental forces or 
being unamenable to high-fidelity sensing and communication technologies. How can we identify and
leverage structure in the complex environment to make our robots more robust? How can we formalize the 
trade-offs seen in systems with embodied intelligence? And how can we bring our insights 
from research to bear on practical systems that can assist humanity and our planet?

My work addresses both:
- theoretical questions about formalization of robotic tasks, representations, and 
resource requirements; and
- practical questions about system design and resilience.

Given design constraints inspired by challenging real-world settings, we develop 
systems that are *minimal* in terms of the sensing,
actuation, computational, or other resource requirements. Minimal agents enable
scalable systems due to their lower cost and size requirements, but we need novel
algorithmic approaches that allow for provable guarantees on
performance and robustness for systems that may have complex or chaotic behavior, 
or be severely under-actuated. Part of achieving real-world robustness and safety
is the principled design of interfaces and specifications, so my work also
involves human-computer/robot interaction (HCI/HRI).

I have published at conferences such as
[ICRA](https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/icra),
[IROS](https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/financially-co-sponsored/iros),
[MRS](https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/technically-co-sponsored/mrs),
[DARS](https://dblp.org/db/conf/dars/index.html),
[RoboSoft](https://softroboticsconference.org/),
[MoCo](https://www.movementcomputing.org/), and [WAFR](http://ifrr.org/wafr),
as well as journals IJRR and MDPI. I was involved in the development of
[The Robot Design Game](https://robot-design.org/index.html).

My Ph.D. in Computer Science (2020) is from the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Dr. Steven M. LaValle](http://lavalle.pl/). I am now a
Postdoc in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Cornell University,
 in Dr. Kirstin Petersen's [Collective Embodied Intelligence (CEI)
Lab](https://cei.ece.cornell.edu/).

    paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0278364921992788) on
    bouncing robots was published! This is the reference I recommend for my
    work on the bouncing robots. Now we can synthesize robust periodic orbits for robots that
    reorient when they collide with environment boundaries!
