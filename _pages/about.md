I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign in Fall 2020, advised by [Dr. Steven M. LaValle](http://lavalle.pl/). I am now a
Postdoc in Dr. Kirstin Petersen's [Collective Embodied Intelligence Lab](https://cei.ece.cornell.edu/)
 in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Cornell University.

My Ph.D.Â work included a deep dive into discrete dynamics, control, and motion planning 
for *bouncing robots*: mobile robots that have structured
interactions with boundaries of their environment. Examples include robot
vacuums that bump into walls to guarantee coverage of an entire room; or micro-robots that swim blindly until they
collide with objects, enabling micro-scale construction. 

My approach involves computing coarse characterizations of the geometry and dynamics of 
robot trajectories. By establishing equivalence classes over the
environment and control spaces, we allow for nondeterminism and uncertainty
at the planning stage and still compute plans that have analytical guarantees on
their stability and long-term dynamical behavior. This allows us to use the intrinsic, messy dynamics of the robot to
engineer robust high-level behaviors such as navigating or patrolling a space,
or even object manipulation or self-assembly.

### Recent News


-   **May 2022**: I will be attending ICRA 2022 in-person in Philly to co-organize workshops
    on [math](https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-frazzoli/workshops/compositional-robotics.html) and
    [art](https://roboticart.org/icra2022/)! Please reach out if you'd like to meet up!
-   **Spring 2022:** I have assisted with [one paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9501972) and [led another](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9501972) on soft, inflatable robot
    collectives. I am excited about the implications of this work for micro-robotics
    as well as macro-scale robot collectives in aquatic and human-robot interaction
    settings!
-   **February 2021:** Our [IJJRR
    paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0278364921992788) on
    bouncing robots was finally published. This is the reference I recommend for our
    proofs on convergence and synthesis of periodic orbits for robots that can
    reorient at environment boundaries.
