My research spans planning, control, and design of mobile robot systems that:

- must navigate environments with many obstacles and narrow passageways, and/or
- cannot access resources such as GPS or computer vision (ex: micro-scale,
underwater), and/or
- are highly reliant on agent-environment interactions to complete tasks (either
through direct contact with obstacles / objects, or by sensing or creating
environment structures such as lower-resistance paths).

Given these design constraints, we develop systems that are *minimal* in terms of the sensing,
actuation, computational, or other resource requirements. Minimal agents enable
 scalable systems, but the research challenge is in developing
representations and algorithmic approaches that allow for provable guarantees on
performance and robustness. Part of achieving real-world robustness and safety
is the principled design of interfaces and specifications, so my work also
involves (human | animal)-(computer | robot) interaction research.

I am targeting applications in entomology, forestry, ecology, 
micro-robotics for health and microbiology, by leveraging embodied intelligence and
approaches from complex systems. I am interested in learning algorithms in the broader context of embodied adaptation and
attunement in robotic and bio-hybrid systems.

I have published at conferences such as
[ICRA](https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/icra),
[IROS](https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/financially-co-sponsored/iros),
[MRS](https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/technically-co-sponsored/mrs),
[DARS](https://dblp.org/db/conf/dars/index.html),
[MoCo](https://www.movementcomputing.org/), and [WAFR](http://ifrr.org/wafr),
as well as journals IJRR and MDPI. I was involved in the development of
[The Robot Design Game](https://robot-design.org/index.html).

My Ph.D. in Computer Science (2020) is from the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Dr. Steven M. LaValle](http://lavalle.pl/). I am now a
Postdoc in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Cornell University,
 in Dr. Kirstin Petersen's [Collective Embodied Intelligence
Lab](https://cei.ece.cornell.edu/).

[My CV is here](files/NillesCV.pdf). My most up-to-date publication record is on
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3AvC70UAAAAJ&hl=en);

### Recent News


-   **November 2022**: Attended [DARS](https://dars2022.org/#/) for the first time and presented work
    on collective systems of Braitenberg vehicles. Such a wonderful conference, and
    so encouraging to see so much discussion of environmental and public health
    applications!
-   **May 2022**: I will be attending ICRA 2022 in-person in Philly to co-organize workshops
    on [math](https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-frazzoli/workshops/compositional-robotics.html) and
    [art](https://roboticart.org/icra2022/)!
-   **Spring 2022:** I have assisted with [one paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9501972) and [led another](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9501972) on soft, inflatable robot
    collectives. I am excited about the implications of this work for micro-robotics
    as well as macro-scale robot collectives in aquatic and human-robot interaction
    settings!
-   **February 2021:** Our [IJRR
    paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0278364921992788) on
    bouncing robots was published! This is the reference I recommend for my
    work on the bouncing robots. Now we can synthesize robust periodic orbits for robots that
    reorient when they collide with environment boundaries!
