I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign in Fall 2020, advised by [Dr. Steven M. LaValle](http://lavalle.pl/). I am now a
Postdoc in Dr. Kirstin Petersen's [Collective Embodied Intelligence Lab](https://cei.ece.cornell.edu/)
 in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Cornell University.


[My CV is here](files/NillesCV.pdf). You can see some of my current projects on
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3AvC70UAAAAJ&hl=en) and

### Recent News


-   **May 2022**: I will be attending ICRA 2022 in-person in Philly to co-organize workshops
    on [math](https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-frazzoli/workshops/compositional-robotics.html) and
    [art](https://roboticart.org/icra2022/)! Please reach out if you'd like to meet up!
-   **Spring 2022:** I have assisted with [one paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9501972) and [led another](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9501972) on soft, inflatable robot
    collectives. I am excited about the implications of this work for micro-robotics
    as well as macro-scale robot collectives in aquatic and human-robot interaction
    settings!
-   **February 2021:** Our [IJJRR
    paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0278364921992788) on
    bouncing robots was finally published. This is the reference I recommend for our
    proofs on convergence and synthesis of periodic orbits for robots that can
    reorient at environment boundaries.
