I develop computational approaches to designing and controlling systems of mobile robotic agents, 
especially those that use embodied intelligence or are strongly influenced by spatio-temporal 
characteristics of their environment. My work addresses both theoretical questions about formalization 
of robotic tasks, representations, and resource requirements, and practical questions about system design and resilience.

My work targets settings that are challenging for traditional approaches to control and planning for mobile robots, such as: 

- persistent environmental monitoring, specifically in forestry, ecology, and robot-animal interactions (especially insects);
- environment-driven underactuated research platforms, such as drifting or energy-harvesting agents; and
- micro-scale agents for medical and microbiological research (~100 microns, low Reynolds environments).

Given these contexts, my work aims to make multi-robot systems more scalable by reducing per-robot resource use, such as battery size, 
sensor resolution and calibration, and wireless communication. Given the design constraints and objectives, we need novel
algorithmic approaches to enable provable guarantees on system performance and robustness even when the system is nondeterministic, chaotic, or under-actuated. 
Part of achieving real-world robustness and safety involves the principled design of interfaces and specifications where humans are in the loop, so my work also
involves human-computer/robot interaction (HCI/HRI) and programming languages.

At its core, my research seeks to answer these questions:

- How can we identify and leverage structure in robot-environment interactions to reduce per-agent resource requirements? 
- How can we formalize the system design trade-offs seen in systems with embodied intelligence, where information processing is offloaded to the robot's embodiment?
- How can we bring our insights from research to bear on practical systems for environmental monitoring and stewardship?

My Ph.D. in Computer Science (2020) is from the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Dr. Steven M. LaValle](http://lavalle.pl/). I am now a
Postdoc in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Cornell University,
 in Dr. Kirstin Petersen's [Collective Embodied Intelligence (CEI)
Lab](https://cei.ece.cornell.edu/).

### Recent News

-   **March 2024**: *Beyond elated* to have accepted an offer from Western Washington University to be an Assistant Professor of Computer Science, starting Fall 2024. The hire was specifically for a robotics faculty, and we are cooking up some really fun stuff that I can't wait to dive into! I am also beyond grateful to everyone at Cornell and the CEI Lab for supporting me during my time there.
-   **May 2023**: I was selected as a [Cyber-Physical Systems Rising Star](https://risingstars.linklab.virginia.edu/2023/participants/alexandra-nilles.html)!
-   **February 2023**: Honored to be a Microsoft Future Leader in Robotics and AI, and to share my work at the University of Maryland Robotics Center.
-   **November 2022**: Attended [DARS](https://dars2022.org/#/) for the first time and presented work
    on collective systems of Braitenberg vehicles. A wonderful conference with much discussion of environmental and public health
    applications!
-   **August 2022**: I will serve as interim PI for the CEI lab for several months, as part of the NSF Career-Life Balance Program. Congrats to Kirstin and Nils on the new addition to their family!
-   **May 2022**: I will be attending ICRA 2022 in-person in Philadelphia to co-organize workshops
    on [math](https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-frazzoli/workshops/compositional-robotics.html) and
    [art](https://roboticart.org/icra2022/)!
-   **Spring 2022:** I have assisted with [one paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9501972) and [led another](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9501972) on soft, inflatable robot
    collectives. I am excited about the implications of this work for micro-robotics
    as well as macro-scale robot collectives in aquatic and human-robot interaction
    settings!
-   **February 2021:** Our [IJRR
    paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0278364921992788) on
    bouncing robots was published! This is the reference I recommend for my
    work on the bouncing robots. Now we can synthesize robust periodic orbits for robots that
    reorient when they collide with environment boundaries!
