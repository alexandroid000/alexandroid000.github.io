I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign in Fall 2020, advised by [Dr. Steven M. LaValle](http://lavalle.pl/). I am now a
Postdoc in Dr. Kirstin Petersen's [Collective Embodied Intelligence Lab](https://cei.ece.cornell.edu/)
 in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Cornell University.


My research agenda focuses on planning, control, and design of mobile robotic systems
for applications in environmental monitoring, micro-robotics, and object
manipulation. I aim to design systems that are minimal, in terms of the sensing,
actuation, and computational requirements, but still have provable guarantees on
performance and robustness.


[My CV is here](files/NillesCV.pdf). My most up-to-date publication record is on
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3AvC70UAAAAJ&hl=en);
contact me if you cannot access a publication.

Code and simulators that I publish and maintain can be found on [my github](https://github.com/alexandroid000)
or the [CEI github](https://github.com/CEI-lab).


### Recent News


-   **November 2022**: Attended [DARS](https://dars2022.org/#/) for the first time and presented work
    on collective systems of Braitenberg vehicles. Such a wonderful conference, and
    so encouraging to see so much discussion of environmental and public health
    applications!
-   **May 2022**: I will be attending ICRA 2022 in-person in Philly to co-organize workshops
    on [math](https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-frazzoli/workshops/compositional-robotics.html) and
    [art](https://roboticart.org/icra2022/)!
-   **Spring 2022:** I have assisted with [one paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9501972) and [led another](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9501972) on soft, inflatable robot
    collectives. I am excited about the implications of this work for micro-robotics
    as well as macro-scale robot collectives in aquatic and human-robot interaction
    settings!
-   **February 2021:** Our [IJJRR
    paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0278364921992788) on
    bouncing robots was published! This is the reference I recommend for my
    work on the bouncing robots. Now we can synthesize robust periodic orbits for robots that
    reorient when they collide with environment boundaries!
