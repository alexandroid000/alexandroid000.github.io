- Learned from RAD Lab and UIUC Dance about movement observation, improvisation,
expressivity, and movement representations and notations
- Applied insights toward a live-coding programming language that enabled human-in-the-loop
realtime design of mobile robot motion patterns, built on top of ROS
- Work in Collective Intelligence Lab continues to leverage movement observation
skills in design and control problems for multi-agent systems
