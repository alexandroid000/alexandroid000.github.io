In collaboration with Steven Ceron, Nils Napp, and Kirstin Petersen, we are
investigating state estimation, control, and synchronization algorithms for
collectives of soft pneumatic robots that inflate and deflate radially. The
robots have embedded proprioceptive strain sensors, and I am particularly
interested in minimalist coordination mechanisms that leverage the
proprioceptive strain information.
